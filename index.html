                  हा ग्रंथ लिहिताना भक्ताच्या हृदयातील शंका, विश्वास आणि उत्कंठा यांचा एक भावपूर्ण संगम उभा केला आहे. पहिल्या अध्यायात महाराजांचा पहिला दिव्य दर्शनप्रसंग 
                  वर्णन केला आहे. हा प्रसंग म्हणजे भक्तीच्या गूढतेचा आरंभबिंदू आहे. महाराज एका निराकार, संन्यासीवेषातील माणसाप्रमाणे शेगावमध्ये अचानक प्रकट झाले. त्यांनी 
                  कोणतेही तांत्रिक चमत्कार केले नाहीत, पण त्यांचा तेजोमय, निर्मळ चेहरा आणि गूढ मौन, हेच त्यांच्या अद्भुततेचं प्रतीक ठरलं. त्यांचे शरीर रेखीव होते, पण सामान्य 
                  नव्हते. डोळ्यांत करुणा आणि अंतरंगात तपश्चर्या होती. त्यांनी कोणालाही आपली ओळख सांगितली नाही, तरी शेगावचे लोक त्यांच्या चरणी ओढले गेले. हा प्रसंग सांगतो

                <p>पहिल्या अध्यायात आपण भगवंताच्या अवताराची नोंद घेतो. हा अध्याय भक्तासाठी नवचैतन्याची स्फूर्ती आहे. ज्यांना वाटतं की आपलं जीवन कोरडं झालंय, अंधार 
                  दाटलाय — त्यांना हा अध्याय एक नवा प्रकाश देतो, गजानन महाराजांच्या दर्शनाने आत्मशुद्धीची पहिली झलक मिळते. या पहिल्या अध्यायातून गजानन महाराजांची
                   प्रकटलीली लीलामय साक्षात्कारी छाया आपल्याला मौनातूनही अध्यात्म शिकवते. भक्तीची ही वाट काही केवळ कथा नसून, ती एक अनुभूती आहे – जी हृदयात गडद
                    होत जाते, जेव्हा गजानन माऊली समोर प्रकट होते. विजयभास्कर अनुभवतो – त्या मौनाच्या प्रसादात अंतर्मन शांत होतं…</p>

जिथे मी संपतो, तिथे तू भरु,<br>

                <p> <strong>कविता: "जंगल पेटलं अन् आभाळही"</strong><br>
                "माणसाच्या मूक अमानुषतेला निसर्गाचा आक्रोश" आजकाल आपण रोजच मोबाइल स्क्रीनवरून मनाच्या गाभ्यापर्यंत पोहोचणाऱ्या पोस्ट पाहतो. पण काही पोस्ट... 
                त्या फक्त माहिती देत नाहीत—त्या आत्मा हलवतात. अशीच एक पोस्ट पाहण्यात आली: हैद्राबादच्या जंगलतोडीची. तिथे मोरांचे टाहो होते... हत्तींच्या चिंचाळ्यांनी आसमंत
                थरथरला होता. आणि आपण फक्त बघत राहिलो—स्क्रोल करत राहिलो—मनात खोल कुठे तरी काही हललं खरं, पण पुन्हा मूळ आयुष्यात परत आलो... जणू काही 
                घडलंच नाही. पण खरं घडलं. झाडं पेटवली गेली. जिवंत प्राणी त्यात जळाले. त्यांचं बाळबोध अस्तित्व धगधगत गेलं आणि आकाशही त्यांच्या वेदनांनी हतबल झालं.
                त्यांच्या नजरेत “का?” हा एकमेव प्रश्न होता. त्यांना कुणी विचारलं का? विचारतो का माणूस? त्याला फक्त “विकास” हवा असतो… पण माणसाचा हा विकास म्हणजे
                निसर्गाचं हत्याकांड आहे.</p>

                <p><strong>तुकाराम महाराज म्हणतात: "वृक्षवल्ली आम्हा सोयरे वनचरे। पक्षीहीनसे सुस्वराचे"  “तेथे पुण्यात्म्यांचे सान्निध्य असते.”</strong><br>
                या ओळींमध्ये ज्या वृक्षवल्लींना "सोयरे" म्हटलं, त्या आपल्याच "सोय"साठी पेटवून टाकल्या. ज्या पक्ष्यांचा सुस्वर म्हणजेच सौंदर्य, त्यांचा शेवटचा आक्रोश आपण ऐकण्याऐवजी
                चिअर्स करत लंच ब्रेकला गेलो. हेच तर अमानुषतेचं मूक रूप आहे. <br>
                <strong>स्वामी विवेकानंद यांचं स्पष्ट मत होतं: "जो प्राणी प्रेम देतो, त्याला त्रास  देणं ही माणसांच्या आध्यात्मिक अधोगतीची सुरवात आहे." </strong><br>
                आज तीच अधोगती समाजाच्या केंद्रस्थानी पोहोचली आहे. प्राण्यांना मारणं म्हणजे केवळ क्रौर्य नाही, तर आपण आपली स्वतःची मानवी ओळख गमावत चाललो आहोत. 
                प्रगतीच्या नावाखाली आपण संवेदना गहाण ठेवत आहोत. <br>
                <strong>ओशो म्हणतात: "Nature is not outside you. You are part of it. And when you destroy Nature, you destroy your own 
                soul." <br>“निसर्ग बाहेर नाही, तो तुमच्याच आत आहे. तुम्ही जेव्हा निसर्ग नष्ट करता, तेव्हा स्वतःचा आत्मा जाळता.”</strong><br></p>
                
                <p>आज माणूस निसर्गाशीच नव्हे तर स्वतःशीच युद्ध करत आहे. भौतिक सुख-सुविधा मिळवण्यासाठी त्याने स्वतःच्या नात्यांवर, प्रेमावर, आत्म्याच्या शांतीवरही आघात केला
                   आहे. पैसा, टॉवर्स, गाड्या, मॉल्स यांच्या शोधात माणूस इतका बिनधास्त झाला आहे की त्याला त्या झाडांमधलं थरथरणं, त्या बछड्यांचं तडफडणं, त्या पक्ष्यांचा शेवटचा
                    आक्रोश काहीच ऐकू येत नाही. या अमानुष क्रौर्यातून कविता जन्म घेते. ही कविता म्हणजे फक्त शब्दांची गुंफण नाही, तर ही प्रकृतीची तडफड, प्राण्यांचा आक्रोश, 
                    निसर्गाच्या अंत:करणाची शोकांतिका आहे. ती वाचणाऱ्याच्या काळजाला चिरते. कारण ती आपल्या सगळ्यांचं मुक सत्य सांगते.</p>
                
                <p> "जंगल पेटलं अन् आभाळही"  <br>कविता: "जंगल पेटलं अन् आभाळही"<br>

जंगल पेटलं होतं, पण तो केवळ धूर नव्हता,<br>
तो होता मोराच्या टाहोचा प्राणवायू,<br>
हत्तीच्या डोळ्यातून ओघळणाऱ्या नीराचा खारा वास,<br>
आणि शेकडो बछड्यांचे कळवळणारे हंबरडे.<br><br>

मनुष्य मात्र बघत होता – स्क्रिनवरून,<br>
नवा प्रोजेक्ट! आय टी पार्क!<br>
पण त्या राखेत त्याचा श्वास होता… त्यालाच कळलं नाही.<br><br>

त्या झाडांनी सावली दिली होती,<br>
त्या पक्ष्यांनी सकाळ जागवली होती,<br>
त्या वेलींच्या कुशीत त्याने लपलेली स्वप्नं पाहिली होती,<br>
आज त्याचं बधिर मौन ही कविता ओरडतेय…<br><br>

जंगल जळतंय, प्राणी रडतायत –<br>
आणि माणूस?<br>
तो अजूनही “नेटवर्क” शोधतोय.<br><br>

अखेरचा प्रश्न:<br><br>

आज जर हेच सगळं तुमच्यावर झालं,<br>
मोरांच्या जागी तुमचं मूल असेल,<br>
हत्तीच्या जागी तुमच्या आईचा प्राण असेल,<br>
आणि त्या आगीत तुमचं घर जळत असेल –<br>
तरीही तुम्ही म्हणाल का… "Just a development plan"?<br><br>

ही कविता, हा परिचय, ही व्यथा – केवळ साहित्य नाही.<br>
ही सृष्टीच्या असहाय आक्रोशाची साक्ष आहे.<br>
ती तुमच्या डोळ्यांत अश्रू आणेल,<br>
तरच तिचा हेतू सफल होईल.<br><br>
